  <h2>House란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>House is a genre of electronic dance music that is characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat and a tempo of 120 to 130 beats per minute.[15] It was created by disc jockeys and music producers from Chicago's underground club culture in the early and mid 1980s,[1] as DJs from the subculture began altering disco dance tracks to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines. As well, these DJs began to mix synth pop, rap, Latin music, and even jazz into their tracks.
