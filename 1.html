  <h2>Techno이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno" target="_blank" title="techno">테크노</a> (techno)는 <strong>전자 음악</strong>의 한 갈래로, 신시사이저를 이용해서 디자인한 <u>기계음</u>을 중심으로 대체로 4/4박자로 구성되며, 기계음이 반복되는 특징을 보이는 음악이다. 80년대 즈음에 등장하여 후에 트랜스(Trance)/하우스(House) 등의 여러 전자 음악에 영향을 주었는데 그중 특히 트랜스와는 연관이 깊었다 (초기의 트랜스는 테크노의 하위갈래로 분류 되었다.) 넓은 의미의 테크노는 전자 음악 그 자체를 가리키기도 한다. 대한민국의 경우 테크노가 트로트 혹은 당시 나이트클럽의 영향을 받아 소위 '뽕'으로 분화하기도 했다. <p> Techno is a genre of electronic dance music[2] that is characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat which is generally produced for use in a continuous DJ set. The central rhythm is often in common time (4/4), while the tempo typically varies between 120 and 150 beats per minute (bpm). Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines, sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio workstations. Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro instruments are popular.

  Detroit techno resulted from the melding of African American styles such as house, funk, and electro with synthpop by artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder and Yellow Magic Orchestra.[3] Added to this is the influence of futuristic and science-fiction themes[4] relevant to life in American late capitalist society, with Alvin Toffler's book The Third Wave a notable point of reference.[5][6] Some producers view the style as an expression of technological spirituality.[7][8] The mid-1980s work of Detroit techno producers Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (collectively known as the Belleville Three) is generally seen as the foundation upon which a number of techno sub-genres have been built.[9]</p>

  During the late 1980s in the UK the term techno was established as a name for the genre following the release of the 1988 compilation Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit.[10][11] Techno also became popular in other European countries, in particular Germany, but also Belgium and the Netherlands [12]. In Europe during the early 1990s techno subgenres such as acid, hardcore, ambient, and dub techno developed. Music journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term; so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as tech house and trance.
